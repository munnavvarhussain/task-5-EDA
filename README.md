Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


📚 About the Project

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship Task 5.

The goal was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to discover patterns, trends, and anomalies.

🛠 Tools and Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Google Colab (for coding)

📊 What I Did
Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset.

Checked for missing values and basic statistics.

Performed Univariate Analysis (Age distribution, Fare analysis, Gender count).

Performed Bivariate Analysis (Survival vs Gender, Survival vs Passenger Class).

Performed Multivariate Analysis (Pairplot, Correlation Heatmap).

Wrote observations for each graph.

Summarized key findings at the end.

🔍 Key Insights
Females had higher survival rates compared to males.

Passengers from 1st class had better survival chances.

Paying a higher fare was associated with a higher chance of survival.

Young children also had higher survival rates.
